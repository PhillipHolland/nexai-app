3. **Morse v. Frederick (2007)** - Schools can restrict drug-related speech
4. **Mahanoy v. B.L. (2021)** - Off-campus social media speech protections

3. **Circuit Court Precedents** - Reasonable accommodation definitions
4. **Recent Developments** - Groff v. DeJoy (2023) raised the bar for undue hardship

**Key Legal Standards**:
- Prima facie case: Religious belief, conflict with job requirement, adverse action
- Employer defense: Undue hardship (more than de minimis cost)
- Interactive process required

**Construction Hierarchy**:
- Intrinsic: Claims, specification, prosecution history
- Extrinsic: Expert testimony, dictionaries, treatises

**Software Patent Considerations**:
- Alice Corp v. CLS Bank (2014) - Abstract idea analysis
- Step 1: Directed to abstract idea?
- Step 2: Inventive concept beyond abstract idea?
