# 🔍 Pre-Deployment Final Review & Checklist

## ⚠️ Critical Items to Address BEFORE Starting

### 1. **Google Cloud Billing Setup**
```bash
# REQUIRED: Get your billing account ID first
gcloud billing accounts list
# Copy the ACCOUNT_ID from the output
# Update in deploy.sh: YOUR_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
```

### 2. **GPU Quota Request** 
```bash
# CRITICAL: Request GPU quota BEFORE running deploy.sh
# Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas
# Search: "GPUs (all regions)" 
# Request: Increase to 4 GPUs minimum
# Wait time: 24-48 hours typically
```

### 3. **Environment Variables Setup**
```bash
# Create local .env additions
cat >> .env << EOF
# Bagel RL Configuration
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=lexai-bagel-rl
BAGEL_MODEL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000
BAGEL_TRAINING_STATUS=pending
